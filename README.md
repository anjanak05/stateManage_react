Q. what is the difference between Props and State?
Ans: Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components
Q. Explain the useState API?
Ans: Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it. During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
Q. Explain the how map, filter, reduce work?
Ans. map(), filter() and reduce() work in the same way: They each accept a function and a sequence of elements and return the result of applying the received function to each element in the sequence.
